Please complete this at your earliest convenience and share a GitHub link to your final solution.  We want you to build a simple React ToDo app.  

The API documentation can be found at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.  You can ignore the other endpoints, just focus on the `/todos` endpoints.  You should have GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE available to you, but POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE don’t actually do anything.  Find a way to make the UI still appear to function even though the data changes aren’t persisted.
Create a list of todos that the user can browse
Allow the user to create a new todo
Allow the user to edit an existing todo
When changes are made have them reflected in the list.

Do your best to use what you feel are React best practices here.  You’re also welcome to use a component library like mui if you like to save having to build your own.  Making it really pretty isn’t entirely necessary, but we won’t begrudge you taking some time there if you wish.
